2.60	Here is a lexical decision task I wrote years ago using PHP and Javascript (github link).	Just for reference, I ended up writing simple web-based lexical decision task software myself.
4.20	It's pretty difficult to imagine a person with Social Anxiety Disorder being an extrovert.	On the surface, it does seem like social anxiety disorder and extroversion shouldn't both exist in the same person.
2.80	It is hard to delineate emotion completely from thoughts or sensations, because emotion can contain both.	Technically speaking, an emotion is not different from thought the way it is processed in brain, both involve neurotransmitters.
0.00	I've found an additional concept that may be related to the original question: prototype theory.	According to current models of human concept learning, the answer to your question is both.
0.00	There are individuals who possess extraordinary memory ability, sometimes called eidetic memory.	There are many arguments for why this is not the case.
2.00	Spike trigger is a specific type or you could say a sub-set of reverse correlations, covariance and probabilities.	There's the naïve version of spike triggered averaging, and the sophisticated version.
0.00	As mentioned in the other comments, ANOVA is problematic when mixing types of predictor variables.	I like to think of multitasking as rapid task switching.
2.60	Q: What is the reason for people to implicitly trust their peers in extreme (or not) situations?	One human-being reliance on other(s) awareness is defined by the level of trust between the humans.
2.60	Intrinsic reward is the emotional pay-off that you get by completing an activity.	According to Frederick Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation, intrinsic rewards are motivators (e.g.
0.00	Presumably the decision of drivers to slow down in response to work zone signage is influenced by many factors.	This short talk deals with issues of "cheating slightly" :Dan Ariely: Our buggy moral code.
2.60	When studying adult IQ, general adult norms are often used.	Basically, what you do is you compare each age group IQ to the standardization sample.
0.00	Some ancient historical precedent exists for preferring $10$, but also for $6$, so that's mixed support from Wikipedia on perfect numbers.	This is indeed possible, but I haven't seen it done experimentally for reasons other than feasibility.
1.60	These are interesting studies, but the bottom line is: yes, environment affects cognitive abilities.	I'm not sure what you mean by cognitive capacity, but I absolutely believe that language shapes the way we think.
0.00	Since this is a relatively new problem for behavioral researchers, I don't know that there is a common consensus.	I'll address just the first of your three sub-questions, the others have been answered by Chuck Sherrington.
0.60	If non-human animals do have intelligence too, why is their intelligence not as advanced as humans?	Your own theory is bad because it seems to follow from a Lamarkian interpretation of evolutionary theory.
1.80	The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is often used to assess psychopathy in clinical settings.	From an article entitled Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?
3.80	I wrap steaks individually in freezer paper, then put them into ziploc freezer bags.	Wrap well in plastic (individually) and then put in a freezer bag.
1.60	In addition to oil, make sure the grill is nice and hot before you start cooking.	I'd been using paper towels to oil the grill, and I just discovered that newspapers work a lot better.
3.20	The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling.	Soak whole ears in the husk in a bowl of water.
2.60	There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour.	The difference is the amount of protein contained in the flour which can range from 5% to 15%.
3.00	I've never adjusted the length of time based on number of eggs.	I don't boil eggs enough to keep a feel for the timing...
1.40	I just hold the cheese closer to the edge away from the grater.	By the wording of the question, I'm pretty sure you're using one of those pyramidal graters or a "sheet" grater.
1.60	I've stored pancakes in the freezer for over two month and not had any freezer burn.	Its going to depend on the type of packaging and also the freezer.
1.60	Break the bulb into cloves, breaking off the bottom and the dry stick that goes up the middle.	lay down a knife horizontaly on the cloves and hit it.
1.00	I managed to find this recipe, I think this is where I got the idea.	I've only made a couple of bbq sauces, but they've always come out really well.
1.80	I  believe one cannot taste the difference between minced(canned) and fresh garlic once it is cooked.	In my experience, fresh garlic is great for when you want texture, or to slow down the flavour infusion.
1.80	I grill salmon that I get with the skin on.	Salmon is a great choice and it's readily available pretty much everywhere.
1.40	The recipe I work from has you put the meat in the freezer, then pan sear it.	Starting with a whole chilled piece of meat, I quickly pour boiling water over all the outside surface.
2.60	They don't taste identical at all, and even more important, they don't smell the same.	Black pepper and white pepper are differing preparations of the fruit of the Piper nigrum plant.
2.00	This depends on the shelf life of the cultivar of tomato you purchased.	Tomatoes will last longer if kept in the fridge, but I actually recommend against keeping them there.
1.00	Coagulated egg proteins in combination with gluten give baked goods the supporting structure they need.	There are basically two types of cakes: butter and sponge (or Génoise).
1.40	A common one is haddock and is in season pretty much year round.	White fish are, as a rule, more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish.
0.60	Good cheddar has little chunks of calcium lactate on/in it - could it be that?	I have two suspicions: One, you're undercooking your roux, the flour and butter mixture, and not fully incorporating the flour.
1.40	Copper can be useful for certain tasks due to the its metallic properties (heats quickly, distributes heat evenly, etc.	Probably subjective, but ... Good clad stainless steel will give you much better cooking performance per dollar than copper.
0.40	She obviously has a legit excuse, although she could have been more responsible and "have" told you in advance.	The first have covers both been more responsible and told you in that sentence.
1.80	In some cases the implication could even be that Tom does not love her.	There is no implication about Tom whatsoever in such a sentence.
4.00	I agree with others (and yourself) in that I have never heard this phrase in English.	I have never heard or seen the phrase you mention.
0.60	The assertion is false, at least as you've restated it here.	"I had mainly been" is fine, in the context you're using it.
2.80	I'd suggest you look to the constructions of the native language(s) of your students.	As bikeboy389 said, you can learn a lot by looking at students' native languages.
2.60	I see some references to status as uncountable as well, but that doesn't make much sense to me.	There are some cases "status" may be accounted of countable.
2.60	If I understand you correctly, you are looking for a hypernym of inclusion and exclusion.	Inclusion is the act of including and exclusion is the act of excluding.
0.60	Firstly, you should be aware that there are two different kinds of dashes: the en dash and the em dash.	Semicolon is used to join sentences that can stand alone, but are joined to emphasize their relationship.
4.40	Pardon the brevity of this answer, but I would say "named" is preferred within the context of your example.	Named is preferred in your example, since you are formally giving a name to your method.
2.20	In standard English, I think "don't got" has the same register as "ain't".	I'd say the expression I don't got... is generally rare in spoken AmE.
1.00	The "more posh" words are usually Latin (occasionally Greek) in origin.	As Shinto pointed out, vulgar words exist in every language.
0.00	I'm American, and I've never heard the bathroom referred to as St. John's.	In situations like these, I tend to lengthen out the phrase.
1.60	The room used for defecation is almost always referred to by euphemism.	I'm English, and would probably use 'toilet' most of the time, and always in the context of a private home.
1.80	I can only think of context using insofar as or insofar that.	The form insofar is American English; the standard form in British and other English is 'in so far'.
3.80	As others have said, "ten of six", though not used in many English speaking areas, would be understood as 5:50.	"Ten of six" probably means 5:50 but I have not heard it before.
3.00	Certainly many usage guides have advised against use of this "singular they" on various "logical" grounds.	Second one  (for writing purpose), if I believe the "THEY/THEIR (SINGULAR)" article.
1.40	This may be overly obvious, but in American English, saying "you're welcome" is certainly polite and standard.	I'm not sure how "Not at all" sounds in response to "thank you".
3.00	Back in the day, "cable" was used to describe communications sent abroad.	The word "cable" has its origins in the days of the telegraph.
0.40	Those expressions could have slightly different meanings especially when talking about finance.	I suspect the phrase originated in the habit of drawing the internet as a cloud shape on network diagrams.
3.60	In the United States, jails are operated by cities and counties (or equivalent).	Jail is a municipal level, prison is on a state/federal/provincial/territory level.
