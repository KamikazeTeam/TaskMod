4	Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed.	Many different ways of calculating these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed.
2	To derive the theorem, we begin with the definition of conditional probability.	In probability theory, the prior and conditional probabilities of two random events are related by Bayes' theorem.

5	Its first application was in the SMART Information Retrieval System.	It was used in the first time in the SMART Information Retrieval System.
0	It doesn't take into account any information about B, so it is "prior".	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.
1	Following this, each web page is given a ranking of 0-10 according to its relevance to a search.	A variation of the PageRank method bases the importance of a webpage on how many visits the page gets.
5	Thus, the program is the best plan for action that is produced.	Thus, the "program" is the optimal plan of action that is being produced.
0	This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	They do not have to be written in a computer language.
4	These subproblems are not, however, independent.	It is similar to divide and conquer, however is differentiated as its subproblems are not independent.
4	The key to Dynamic Programming is to find the structure of optimal solutions.	In general, dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems, where the most efficient solution is needed.
3	When a document is represented as a vector, each dimension corresponds to a separate term.	Each dimensions corresponds to a separate terms.
